Common additional ingredients include dried, candied, or fresh fruit, nuts, cocoa, and extracts such as vanilla, with numerous substitutions for the primary ingredients. Cakes can also be filled with fruit preserves, nuts or dessert sauces (like custard, jelly, cooked fruit, whipped cream or syrups),[1] iced with buttercream or other icings, and decorated with marzipan, piped borders, or candied fruit.Cake is often served as a celebratory dish on ceremonial occasions, such as weddings, anniversaries, and birthdays. There are countless cake recipes; some are bread-like, some are rich and elaborate, and many are centuries old.

The first prototype of a blockchain is dated back to the early 1990s when computer scientist Stuart Haber and physicist W. Scott Stornetta applied cryptographic techniques in a chain of blocks as a way to secure digital documents from data tampering. The work of Haber and Stornetta certainly inspired the work of Dave Bayer, Hal Finney, and many other computer scientists and cryptography enthusiasts - which eventually lead to the creation of Bitcoin, as the first decentralized electronic cash system (or simply the first cryptocurrency). The Bitcoin whitepaper was published in 2008 under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto.Although the blockchain technology is older than Bitcoin, it is a core underlying component of most cryptocurrency networks, acting as a decentralized, distributed and public digital ledger that is responsible for keeping a permanent record (chain of blocks) of all previously confirmed transactions.",

              "description":"In telecommunications, 5G is the fifth-generation technology standard for broadband cellular networks, which cellular phone companies began deploying worldwide in 2019, and is the planned successor to the 4G networks which provide connectivity to most current cellphones. 5G networks are predicted to have more than 1.7 billion subscribers worldwide by 2025, according to the GSM Association.[1]Like its predecessors, 5G networks are cellular networks, in which the service area is divided into small geographical areas called cells. All 5G wireless devices in a cell are connected to the Internet and telephone network by radio waves through a local antenna in the cell. The new networks have higher download speeds, eventually up to 10 gigabits per second (Gbit/s).[2] In addition to 5G being faster than existing networks, 5G has higher bandwidth and can thus connect more different devices, improving the quality of Internet services in crowded areas.[3] Due to the increased bandwidth, it is expected the networks will increasingly be used as general internet service providers (ISPs) for laptops and desktop computers, competing with existing ISPs such as cable internet, and also will make possible new applications in internet-of-things (IoT) and machine-to-machine areas. Cellphones with 4G capability alone are not able to use the new networks, which require 5G-enabled wireless devices.",

              "description":"The global cyber threat continues to evolve at a rapid pace, with a rising number of data breaches each year. A report by RiskBased Security revealed that a shocking 7.9 billion records have been exposed by data breaches in the first nine months of 2019 alone. This figure is more than double (112%) the number of records exposed in the same period in 2018. Medical services, retailers and public entities experienced the most breaches, with malicious criminals responsible for most incidents. Some of these sectors are more appealing to cybercriminals because they collect financial and medical data, but all businesses that use networks can be targeted for customer data, corporate espionage, or customer attacks.With the scale of the cyber threat set to continue to rise, the International Data Corporation predicts that worldwide spending on cyber-security solutions will reach a massive $133.7 billion by 2022. Governments across the globe have responded to the rising cyber threat with guidance to help organizations implement effective cyber-security practices.",

Today, IBM Quantum makes real quantum hardware -- a tool scientists only began to imagine three decades ago -- available to thousands of developers. Our engineers deliver ever-more-powerful superconducting quantum processors at regular intervals, building toward the quantum computing speed and capacity necessary to change the world. These machines are very different from the classical computers that have been around for more than half a century. Here's a primer on this transformative technology.",

              "description":"The entire movie can be described as a mix of parts equally bad and good. With a premise very similar to the slightly better 'Vairam', there is much potential at disposal which is not efficiently harnessed by veteran S.N.Swami's script. Mohanlal plays the cameo to perfection but the role is given more importance than it is due thereby sidelining the major issue of the movie. Suresh Gopi shines with a believable performance but the transition to the vigilante is not sketched out effectively. Harisree Ashokan, Biju Menon and Mohini phones it in while Vijayaraghavan has a few scene stealing moments which he does with aplomb. The movie also skims over the serious issue it deals with just as a framework for a thriller which is unfortunate, in my opinion, as it is a major one in the real world now. An average thriller which may work for you if you don't have much expectations from a Mohanlal-Suresh Gopi movie, which is hardly true in my case.",

Vishal's progress as a director is astounding!The film is adapted from Shakeaspere's Macbeth, using Mumbai underworld as the backdrop. Charecterizations are brillaint, with the witches in Macbeth, being metamorphosed into two corrupt cops.The screenplay, cinematography, sound design are dialogues are brilliant. The performances from all the 5 key players, Irrfan, Tabu, Pankaj Kapur, and the two cops, Naseer and Om Puri are out of the world. Music is imaginative with captive visualizations.Credit for the entire movie should go to Vishal, for his outstanding conceptualization and execution. A special word, for cinematographer Hemant Chaturvedi. His final shot of Irrfan falling on the ground in the hospital, with a slow motion of a pigeon, followed by a changing color from normal light to serene green, followed by the fall with a tilted camera is worth going miles for! Bravo!",
